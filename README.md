#### Einstein Gravity, The Foundation of Cosmology's Century
Presented to The Albuquerque Astronomical Society on October 23, 2021

What does **General Relativity** have to do with Data Science? Both **Quant Finance** and **Data Science** is pushed forward by Researchers with a Physics Background. My Repository on **Gravitational Wave Detection** (soon to be added) demonstrates **leading edge** analytical approaches such as **Spectral Analysis" to *tease out* the signal from the noise. This also captures any periodic behavior.
